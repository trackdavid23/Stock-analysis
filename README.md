# Stock-analysis

OVERVIEW: VBA Stock Analysis Project
Purpose
In this project and analyisis, we’ll edit, or refactor, the Stock Market Dataset with VBA solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect an entire dataser. Then, we’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, we just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read..

Time on VBA_Challenge_2018 Our stock analysis outputs for 2017 and 2018 are the same as dataset example provided, shows that these companies did better in 2017 then they did in 2018. by the by having over 25% growth compare to the 2018 counterparts.

### Deliverable with detail analysis:
You need to perform code refactoring in small steps. Make tiny changes in your program, each of the small changes makes your code slightly better and leaves the application in a working state. 

## Disadvantages:
A long procedure may contain the same line of code in several locations, you can change the logic to eliminate the duplicate lines.
A logical structure may be duplicated in two or more procedures (possibly via copy & paste coding). When detected, this logic is best moved to a new function and called from the other functions.
A complex unstructured code is usually best to split in several functions.
Refactoring process can affect the testing outcomes.

## Advantages:**
Logical errors easily appear in well structure code that contains nested conditionals and loops.
In our case, using Excel flow displays program logic in a more comprehensible manner, not tied to the order that the underlying code is written.
VBA interpretation (Excel) of code can reveal patterns that are not easy to see in the source.
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**
Improving or updating the code without changing the software’s functionality or external behavior of the application is known as code refactoring. If you didn’t pay attention to improve your code or to restructure your code, you will ened up getting an error.

Unnecessary clutter in a home can create a chaotic and stressful environment. - The same goes for written code. A clean and well-organized code is always easy to change, easy to understand, and easy to maintain. You can avoid facing difficulty later if you pay attention to the code refactoring process earlier.
